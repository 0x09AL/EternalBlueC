//Contains a SMB Trans2 Request, SESSION_SETUP from a Wannacry PCAP

The picture above shows that the SESSION_SETUP parameter fields are used to indicate the offset and total lengths of payload bytes.

The data is 12 bytes longâ€”the first four bytes indicate total length
the next four bytes is reserved, and the last 4 bytes are the current offsets of the payload bytes in little-endian. 
These fields are encoded with master XOR key

Because the reserved field is supposed to be 0, the reserved field is actually the same as the master XOR key. 
Going back to the packet capture above, the reserved field value is 0x38a9dbb6, which is the master XOR key. 
The total length is encoded as 0x38f9b8be. When this length is XORed with the master XOR key, it is 0x506308
which is the actual length of the payload bytes being uploaded. 
The last field is 0x38b09bb6. When XORed with the master key, this last field becomes 0, 
meaning this packet is the first packet of the payload upload.


The transferred and decoded bytes are of size 0x50730c. 
As a whole, these packet bytes include kernel shellcode, userland shellcode, and the main WannaCrypt PE packages.

Trans2.SESSION_SETUP.Parameters is of 0xC (12) bytes and contains below information encrypted by XOR key.
1. Total Size of Payload
2. Chunk Size
3. Offset of Chunk in Payload

Trans2.SESSION_SETUP.Parameters value = 6a620858 62015858 62115858
Total Size of Payload = (0x5808626a) ^ (0x58581162) = 0x507308
 Chunk Size = (0x58580162) ^ (0x58581162) = 0x1000(4096)
Offset of Chunk in Payload = (0x58581162) ^ (0x58581162) = 0

Another example of Trans2.SESSION_SETUP.Parameters value = 6a620858 62015858 62015858
Total Size of Payload = (0x5808626a) ^ (0x58581162) = 0x507308
Chunk Size = (0x58580162) ^ (0x58580162) = 0x1000(4096)
Offset of Chunk in Payload = (0x58580162) ^ (0x58581162) = 0x1000(4096)
