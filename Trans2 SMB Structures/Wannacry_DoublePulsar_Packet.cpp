//Contains a SMB Trans2 Request, SESSION_SETUP from a Wannacry PCAP

The picture above shows that the SESSION_SETUP parameter fields are used to indicate the offset and total lengths of payload bytes.

The data is 12 bytes longâ€”the first four bytes indicate total length
the next four bytes is reserved, and the last 4 bytes are the current offsets of the payload bytes in little-endian. 
These fields are encoded with master XOR key

Because the reserved field is supposed to be 0, the reserved field is actually the same as the master XOR key. 
Going back to the packet capture above, the reserved field value is 0x38a9dbb6, which is the master XOR key. 
The total length is encoded as 0x38f9b8be. When this length is XORed with the master XOR key, it is 0x506308
which is the actual length of the payload bytes being uploaded. 
The last field is 0x38b09bb6. When XORed with the master key, this last field becomes 0, 
meaning this packet is the first packet of the payload upload.
